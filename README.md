# Hey there, Nice to Meet You!👋  I'm Najma Bader 

I grew up in a hippie family but I fell in love with coding. <br/>
I am now a data engineer who loves building data pipelines for business insights, scaling systems up, and shipping reliable applications. <br/>
I am also a self-taught programmer on a mission to make coding accessible to everyone. On Medium at @thehippieandtheboss.


Yep.. This is how my parents used to carry me around..
